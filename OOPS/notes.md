1. Abstraction-
Abstraction in JavaScript refers to the concept of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes, objects, or functions to hide unnecessary details while exposing essential features. It helps in managing and organizing code more effectively.


2. Encapsulation-
Encapsulation in JavaScript is like putting your data and the functions that work with that data into a safe container, like a box. This box has a lock on it, so only certain methods (functions) can interact with the data inside.
